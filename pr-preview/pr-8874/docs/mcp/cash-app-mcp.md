### Build a Cart and Check Out

Once you've found what you want, tell goose to build your order. It handles item selection, modifiers, and quantities — then gives you a checkout link to complete payment through Cash App.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a Classic Falafel Sandwich and a Ginger Lemonade to my cart.
```
